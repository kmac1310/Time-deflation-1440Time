This chart illustrates the inverse relationship between the purchasing power of traditional currency (specifically the dollar) and the value of time from 1980 to 2030. The red line represents the declining purchasing power of the dollar, which is a direct result of inflation over time. As the money supply increases and the value of each dollar decreases, we see a downward trend in purchasing power.
Conversely, the green line represents the value of time, which has been increasing, especially rapidly since 2022. This increase is attributed to technological advancements, particularly in AI, which have dramatically improved productivity. The chart introduces the concept of "time deflation," suggesting that each unit of time (e.g., an hour) can accomplish more now than in the past, effectively increasing its value.
The chart highlights key events like the introduction of AI/ChatGPT in 2022, which correlates with a sharp uptick in time value. It also mentions the 1440TIME system, which appears to be a method of quantifying and tokenizing time to better capture and utilize its increasing value.
Imagine you have a dollar bill from 1980. Back then, that dollar could buy you more stuff than it can today. That's what the red line shows - how the power of a dollar to buy things has been going down over time. This happens because things generally get more expensive as years go by, which we call inflation.
Now, let's think about time - like an hour of your day. The green line shows how the value of that hour has been going up, especially since 2022. This is because of all the new technology we have, especially things like AI (artificial intelligence) and chatbots. These tools help us do much more in an hour than we could before.
For example, in 1980, it might have taken you an hour to research something in a library. Now, you can find that same information in minutes using a computer or smartphone. So, each hour of your time is worth more because you can do more with it.
The chart is saying that while money (dollars) is becoming less powerful over time, your time is becoming more valuable. It suggests that we should start thinking about our time as if it were money - something precious that we should use wisely.
The 1440TIME mentioned in the chart seems to be a new way of thinking about time, treating each minute as a valuable token, kind of like treating each minute as a coin in your pocket. The idea is to help people realize just how valuable their time has become in our modern world.
